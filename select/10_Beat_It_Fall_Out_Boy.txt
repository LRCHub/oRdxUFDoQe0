Just beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Show 'em how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You got to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Show 'em how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Beat it

No one wants to be defeated
Show 'em how funky strong is your fight
